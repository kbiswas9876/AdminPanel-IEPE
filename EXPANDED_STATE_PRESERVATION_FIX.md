# Expanded State Preservation Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Addressed

**Issue**: After saving an in-place edit, the question card would collapse, losing the user's context and requiring them to find and re-expand the card to verify their changes.

**Impact**: This created a disruptive user experience where users lost their place and had to re-navigate to see the results of their edits.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ExpandableQuestionList Component

**Added `editingQuestionId` prop** to track which question is currently being edited:
```typescript
interface ExpandableQuestionListProps {
  // ... existing props
  editingQuestionId?: number | null
}
```

**Added expanded state preservation logic**:
- When data updates occur (from optimistic updates or server responses), the component now preserves the expanded state for questions that still exist
- Added a `useEffect` to ensure the question being edited remains expanded
- Enhanced the data update logic to maintain expanded state across re-renders

### 2. Updated QuestionExplorer Component

**Added `editingQuestionId` prop** and passed it through to `ExpandableQuestionList`:
```typescript
interface QuestionExplorerProps {
  // ... existing props
  editingQuestionId?: number | null
}
```

**Improved data flow** to ensure cached questions are treated as filtered data for proper state preservation.

### 3. Updated ContentManagement Component

**Passed the editing question ID** to the QuestionExplorer:
```typescript
<QuestionExplorer
  // ... existing props
  editingQuestionId={editingQuestion?.id || null}
/>
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Expanded State Preservation Logic

```typescript
// Preserve expanded state when updating data
setData(prevData => {
  const newData = filteredData
  // If this is an update (not initial load), preserve expanded state for existing questions
  if (prevData.length > 0 && newData.length > 0) {
    // Keep expanded state for questions that still exist
    const preservedExpandedIds = new Set<number>()
    expandedQuestionIds.forEach(id => {
      if (newData.some(q => q.id === id)) {
        preservedExpandedIds.add(id)
      }
    })
    setExpandedQuestionIds(preservedExpandedIds)
  }
  return newData
})
```

### Editing State Management

```typescript
// Ensure the question being edited remains expanded
useEffect(() => {
  if (editingQuestionId && !expandedQuestionIds.has(editingQuestionId)) {
    setExpandedQuestionIds(prev => new Set([...prev, editingQuestionId]))
  }
}, [editingQuestionId, expandedQuestionIds])
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. ❌ Question card collapsed after saving edit
2. ❌ User lost context and had to find the question again
3. ❌ Had to re-expand the card to verify changes
4. ❌ Disruptive workflow interruption

### After
1. ✅ Question card remains expanded after saving
2. ✅ User maintains visual context of their edit
3. ✅ Immediate visual confirmation of successful update
4. ✅ Seamless, non-disruptive workflow

## Benefits

1. **Preserved User Context**: Users can immediately see the results of their edits
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No need to re-navigate or re-expand cards
3. **Improved Workflow**: Seamless editing experience without interruptions
4. **Visual Confirmation**: Users get immediate feedback that their changes were applied
5. **Professional UX**: Matches modern application expectations

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Edit and Save**: Verify question remains expanded after save
2. **Multiple Edits**: Test with multiple questions expanded
3. **Filter Changes**: Ensure expanded state preserved during filtering
4. **Cache Updates**: Verify state preservation during optimistic updates
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when save operations fail

## Integration with Existing Features

This fix works seamlessly with:
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Client-side caching
- ✅ Skeleton loading states
- ✅ Manual refresh functionality
- ✅ Multi-select operations
- ✅ Filtering and sorting

## Conclusion

The expanded state preservation fix ensures that users maintain their context and visual confirmation after editing questions. This creates a professional, seamless editing experience that matches modern application standards and significantly improves the user workflow in the Content Management module.
