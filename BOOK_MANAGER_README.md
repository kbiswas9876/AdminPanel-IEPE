# Book Manager Feature - Chicken & Egg Problem Solved! ✅

## Problem Solved
The classic chicken-and-egg problem: You couldn't add questions without selecting a `book_source`, but the dropdown was empty because no books existed yet. This is now completely resolved with a dedicated Book Manager system.

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ **New Database Table: `book_sources`**
You need to create this table in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_sources (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  code TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Table Structure:**
- `id`: Auto-generated primary key
- `name`: Full book name (e.g., "Pinnacle 6800 6th Ed")
- `code`: Short unique code (e.g., "PIN6800")
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### ✅ **Book Manager Page (`/books`)**
- **New navigation link** in sidebar with 📖 icon
- **Protected route** with authentication
- **Professional UI** with cards and tables
- **Real-time updates** after operations

### ✅ **Add New Book Form**
- **Two input fields**: Book Name and Book Code
- **Form validation**: Required fields and duplicate code checking
- **Auto-uppercase**: Book codes are automatically converted to uppercase
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures
- **Success feedback**: Form resets after successful creation

### ✅ **Book Sources Table**
- **Display all books** with Name, Code, and Created date
- **Professional styling** with proper spacing
- **Delete functionality** with confirmation dialog
- **Safety checks**: Cannot delete books being used by questions
- **Empty state**: Helpful message when no books exist

### ✅ **Server Actions**
- **`getBookSources()`**: Fetch all book sources
- **`getBookSourceNames()`**: Get just the names for dropdowns
- **`createBookSource()`**: Create new book with validation
- **`deleteBookSource()`**: Safe deletion with usage checks

### ✅ **Updated Question Forms**
- **Dynamic dropdown** now populated from `book_sources` table
- **Helpful message** when no books are available
- **Consistent data source** for all question forms
- **Better user experience** with proper validation

## How to Set Up

### Step 1: Create the Database Table
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Table Editor" → "Create a new table"
3. Name: `book_sources`
4. **Uncheck "Enable Row Level Security (RLS)"**
5. Add columns:
   - `id` (bigint, Primary Key, auto-generated)
   - `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
   - `name` (text, not nullable)
   - `code` (text, not nullable, unique)
6. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Test the Book Manager
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Book Manager:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Log in with your admin credentials
   - Click "Book Manager" in the sidebar

3. **Add your first book:**
   - Fill in "Book Name": "Pinnacle 6800 6th Ed"
   - Fill in "Book Code": "PIN6800"
   - Click "Save Book"
   - Verify it appears in the table

4. **Test the question form:**
   - Go to "Content Management" → "Add New Question"
   - Check that the Book Source dropdown now shows your book
   - You can now create questions!
